# Unsupervised_clustering_of_different_hand_gestures
Unsupervised learning algorithm is used to classify diffrent hand gestures. Principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are used respectively.
At first choose the current folder path. Import the 'unsupervised.mat' file to the workspace, then run 'num.m'.
It was done in MATLAB 2013a. If you use other versions, then you should look for 'princomp' little bit.It might throw you 'undefined function' error.
